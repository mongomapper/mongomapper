h2(#finders). Finders

h3(#find). find

Find one or more documents by their _id.

{% highlight ruby %}
# works with string representation of object id
Patient.find('4da32870c198a73ca3000001')

# or with actual object id
Patient.find(BSON::ObjectId.from_string('4da32870c198a73ca3000001'))

# also works with array of ids or multiple arguments
Patient.find(['4da32870c198a73ca3000001', '4da32870c198a73ca3000002'])
Patient.find('4da32870c198a73ca3000001', '4da32870c198a73ca3000002')
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#all). all

Get all of the documents in a query as an array. Works with options or criteria.

{% highlight ruby %}
Patient.all(:last_name => 'Johnson', :order => :last_name.asc)
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#first). first

Get the first document in a query. Naturally, this makes the most sense when you have also provided a means of "sorting":#sort.

{% highlight ruby %}
Patient.first(:order => :created_at.desc)
Patient.first(:email => 'john@doe.com')
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#last). last

Get the last document in a query. Naturally, this makes the most sense when you have also provided a means of "sorting":#sort.

{% highlight ruby %}
Patient.last(:order => :created_at.asc)
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#paginate). paginate

Paginate the query.

{% highlight ruby %}
Patient.paginate({
  :order    => :created_at.asc,
  :per_page => 25, 
  :page     => 3,
})
{% endhighlight %}

h2(#criteria). Criteria

Mongo has rich support for "dynamic queries":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Querying. MongoMapper uses ["Plucky":https://github.com/jnunemaker/plucky] to construct query proxy objects that only retrieve data from Mongo when needed.  This allows a query to be composed of several conditions before being evaluated.

h3(#where). where

Use @where@ to specify your query criteria.

{% highlight ruby %}
patients = Patient.where(:first_name => "John", :last_name => "Johnson")
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#fields). fields

Sometimes you know you are loading objects for a very specific purpose–maybe to show a few fields on the UI. You can limit the number of fields returned with data filled in as follows:

{% highlight ruby %}
query = Patient.where(:last_name => "Johnson").
        fields(:last_name, :gender).all
#=> [#<Patient created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, _id: BSON::ObjectId('4d140b878951a202ae000002'), gender: "M", last_name: "Johnson", first_name: nil>]
{% endhighlight %}

*Note that all the other attributes in your model will be nil (or set to their default value)*. Therefore, if you call a method that makes use of all the attributes–like @to_json@–then keep in mind that the values will be nil, and you will need to emit only those fields:

{% highlight ruby %}
query.to_json(:only => [:last_name, :gender])
#=> "[{\"last_name\":\"Johnson\",\"gender\":\"M\"}]"
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#count). count

Instead of returning an array of complete documents, you may want to merely check to see how many exist.

{% highlight ruby %}
patients = Patient.where( :last_name.gte => 'A', :last_name.lt => 'B' ).count
#=> 1803
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#sort). sort, order

You can choose to sort the documents by various keys, ascending (default) or descending.

{% highlight ruby %}
Patient.sort(:last_name)

Patient.where(:updated_at.gte => 3.days.ago).sort(:updated_at.desc)
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#limit). limit

You can limit the number of documents returned by the query.

{% highlight ruby %}
patients = Patient.sort(:last_name).limit(10)
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#skip). skip, offset

Skip is used to return a list of documents beyond the number that are requested to be skipped.

{% highlight ruby %}
patients = Patient.sort(:last_name).limit(10).skip(10)
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#operators). Operators

Mongo supports quite a few "conditional operators":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries#AdvancedQueries-ConditionalOperators. You can use these directly in your MongoMapper queries.

{% highlight ruby %}
User.where(:age => {:$gt => 21, :$lt => 30})
{% endhighlight %}

MongoMapper also provides shorthand for most of these operators.

{% highlight ruby %}
User.where(:age.gt => 21)
{% endhighlight %}

See MongoDB's "documentation on conditional operators":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries#AdvancedQueries-ConditionalOperators.

h2(#destroy_documents). Destroying documents

MongoMapper provides 2 methods for destroying/deleting documents and 2 methods for removing/destroying all documents.

h3(#destroy). destroy

Destroy a single or multiple document(s) by providing ID(s) or tne instance of a document

{% highlight ruby %}
# Destroy a single user with the given ID
User.destroy("50a210d2f7aa6006d2000001") 

# Destroys two user with given ids
User.destroy("50a210d2f7aa6006d2000001", "50a21153f7aa6006d2000002") 

# Delete an instance
u = User.create(:name => cow)
u.destroy 
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#destroy_all). destroy_all

Destroy all or multiple documents from given matching criteria
Warning: You can loose all your data if you call this at the wrong time.

{% highlight ruby %}
# Destroy every user in the collection
User.destroy_all

# Destroys user with a given name
User.destroy_all(:name => "George")
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#delete). delete

Delete document(s) from given ID(s) or the delete an instance of a document. 
Callbacks are NOT triggered.

Usage is identical to destroy

h3(#delete_all). delete_all

Delete multiple or all documents.
Callbacks are NOT triggered.

Usage is identical to destroy_all
