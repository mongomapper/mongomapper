I'm happy to announce the new MongoMapper.com. This site will be a home for all things MongoMapper, including documentation, tutorials, and announcements.

This site marks a maturation of MongoMapper. What started as an experiment, simply to learn MongoDB, has turned into a nice piece of software with a wonderful community wrapped around it.

Documentation
-------------

MongoMapper now has some [documentation](/documentation/). It is far from comprehensive or complete, but it is a good start. Thanks to these people for contributing.
