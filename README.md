## Open Commit Policy

Like Rubinius, we're trying out an "open commit policy".

If you've committed one (code) patch that has been accepted and would like to
work some more on the project, send an email to Scott Taylor
<scott@railsnewbie.com> along with your commit sha1.

## Compatibility

MongoMapper is tested against:

* MRI 2.4 - 3.0.1
* JRuby (Versions with 1.9 compatibility)

Additionally, MongoMapper is tested against:

* Rails 5.0 - 5.2
* Rails 6.0 - 6.1

Note, if you are using Ruby 3.0+, you'll need Rails 6.

## Contributing & Development

    $ git clone https://github.com/mongomapper/mongomapper && cd mongomapper
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix. All specs should pass.
* Add specs for your changes. This is important so that it doesn't break in a future version.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself in another branch so a maintainer can ignore it when your pull request is merged.
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
